\section{Topic Definition}

Developing software has become more and more working in group. One reason for this is agile methodologies like Scrum and XP that has been come more and more common project management techniques in software development. Groupwork will add it's own challenges and benefits to the development process.

Giving a focus on improving group work is one way to tackle challenges that newer project management practices bring on the table. One of the ways of improvement is achieving better shared understanding between different stakeholders of the development group. Shared understanding is term that describes the level of knoweledge about project that different stakeholders share a same vision.

One way in trying to improve shared understanding in software projects is usage of different kinds of desing methodologies and mapping techniques. In this thesis work I will try to find answer for the question that does this kind of methods create better shared understanding between stakeholders in development group.

\section{Research Plan}


In this research I will use two groups. Both groups will design the solution for same software project. Both groups will consist four students from department of Computer Science at University of Helsinki. Student subjects will be selected randomly from the group of students that will participate in course software systems that will be held in autumn 2015.

Student subjects will be divided to groups randomly. After grouping has been done all subjects will answer five factor personality model questionare\cite{fiveFactor}. This test will give me information about personalities and after the experiment I can compare results to allrady known personality questions in group work.

After the personality test both groups will do design phase of the given software project. Groupa A will be the group which will be given framework for design process. Framework used in this research is methodology User Story Mapping that is developed by Jeff Patton\cite{userStoryMapping}. User Story Mapping is chosen because it is new methdology and researcher are familiar with that methodology which make it easier to teach methdology to student subjects. There are plenty of others design frameworks that are used in software development and those could be also used in this research.

Group B is control group which will be working with no design methdologies. Student's are chosen from the course where they do not have much design and framework experience before experiment. In case where subjects are well knoweledged about design frameworks it might end up the case where control group will decide to use some methodology that group will know before hand. In the case where control group works with certain design methodology there is not way to find answer to research question which is looking for answer advantage of usege of design methodology.

After training session of group A both groups will work with given problem and will try to design solution as best as they can. These session will be video recorded to gather more material about desing process and for evaluation of usage of desing methodology. When the desing process is finished and subjects will answer three different questionares that will give researcher tools to evaluate achieved shared understanding, created social networks and solution that was achieved.


\section{Previous Studies}

Humayun etc. studied effect of organizational structure in global software development (GSD) \cite{organizationalStructure}. Research question of the paper was set to "What is the impact of 'A clear organizational structure with communicating resposibilities' on shared understanding of requirements in GSD?".
