\section{Topic Definition}

Developing software has become more and more working in group. One reason for this is agile methodologies like Scrum and XP that has been come more and more common project management techniques in software development. Groupwork will add it's own challenges and benefits to the development process.

Giving a focus on improving group work is one way to tackle challenges that newer project management practices bring on the table. One of the ways of improvement is achieving better shared understanding between different stakeholders of the development group. Shared understanding is term that describes the level of knoweledge about project that different stakeholders share a same vision.

One way in trying to improve shared understanding in software projects is usage of different kinds of desing methodologies and mapping techniques. In this thesis work I will try to find answer for the question that does this kind of methods create better shared understanding between stakeholders in development group.

\section{Research Plan}


In this research I will use two groups. Both groups will design the solution for same software project. Both groups will consist four students from department of Computer Science at University of Helsinki. Student subjects will be selected randomly from the group of students that will participate in course software systems that will be held in autumn 2015.

Student subjects will be divided to groups randomly. After grouping has been done all subjects will answer five factor personality model questionare\cite{fiveFactor}. This test will give me information about personalities and after the experiment I can compare results to allrady known personality questions in group work.

After the personality test both groups will do design phase of the given software project. Groupa A will be the group which will be given framework for design process. Framework used in this research is methodology User Story Mapping that is developed by Jeff Patton\cite{userStoryMapping}. User Story Mapping is chosen because it is new methdology and researcher are familiar with that methodology which make it easier to teach methdology to student subjects. There are plenty of others design frameworks that are used in software development and those could be also used in this research.

Group B is control group which will be working with no design methdologies. Student's are chosen from the course where they do not have much design and framework experience before experiment. In case where subjects are well knoweledged about design frameworks it might end up the case where control group will decide to use some methodology that group will know before hand. In the case where control group works with certain design methodology there is not way to find answer to research question which is looking for answer advantage of usege of design methodology.

After training session of group A both groups will work with given design problem and will design solution as best as they could. These design session will be video recorded to gather more information about used desing process and how different group dynamic . After finishing design process subjects will answer three different questionares that will give researcher tools to evaluate achieved shared understanding, created social networks and solution that was achieved in design process.


\section{Previous Studies}

\subsection{Shared Understanding in Software Development}

Humayun etc. studied effect of organizational structure in global software development (GSD) \cite{organizationalStructure}. Research question of the paper was set to "What is the impact of 'A clear organizational structure with communicating resposibilities' on shared understanding of requirements in GSD?". From the findings of their studies we can conclude that clear organizational structure has clear improvement on achived shared understanding between different participants on development team.

Humayun etc. used concept mapping technique called Analysis Constructed Shared Mental Model (ACSMM) in measuring achived shared understanding between deifferent participants of experiment. In their experiment researchers had two different groups in study. One group did have clear organizational structure and communication protocol between different developers. Clear communication protocol had improving effect on Knoweledge Management (KM)\cite{organizationalStructure}.

\subsection{Skills Affecting on Groupwork}

Software design process is more and more about group work and sharing knoweledge about project that is under development. Communication and understanding each others cultural background will affect on knoweledge will be trasported between others. In research paper Zarndt lists basic fundamentals how cultur and communication can be noticed in process\cite{culturalCommunication}. Respect is the most important aspect of clear communication in cross-culturall enviroment based on research paper. Other important factors in communication in these situations keeping it simple and repeating sayings. By repeating all participants can be sure that shared understanding between each other is achieved\cite{culturalCommunication}.

\subsection{Shared Understanding Research Methods}

There is several different methdos that can be used in investigating shared understanding and mental models of humans. Few examples of these methods are Analysis Constructed Shared Mental Model (ACSMM), Surface Matching and Deep Structure (SMD), Model Inspection Trace of Concepts and Relations (MITOCAR) and Dynamic Evaluation of Enhanced Problem-solving (DEEP). Each of these methods have it own strengths and weaknesess and they can be used in defferent occasions\cite{mentalModelResearch}.

\subsubsection{ACSMM}

ACSMM technique will change individual mental models to map that will show team sharedness and still keep details of inviduals vision. Technique is divided in five parts. First part is creating topic analyse that will help  individuals to make their own concept maps. Second and thrid phase of method is creating individual maps using Individually Constructed Mental Model (ICMM) elictation. After individual models has been created collected data will be used to determine which concept are shared between different individuals. Sharadness level shuold be decided to determine which is the level when concept is considered shared between memberes of the group. Johnson etc. said that good level to start is 50 percentage\cite{mentalModelResearch}. Last part of the model is creating shared mental model. This will include construction process in which different ICMM models are mapped together and result will show sharedness between those models. This technique can be used to evaluate sharedness over time and between different teams\cite{mentalModelResearch}.

\subsubsection{SMD}

SMD-technology uses three different instructional treatments. Data can be collected from concept maps or from natural language. Three treatments are named surface structure analysis, structurial properties analysis and deep structure analysis. SMD-technique can be used on determining team sharedness of change over time or between different teams\cite{mentalModelResearch}.

\subsubsection{MITOCAR}

Mitocar is based on software tool that uses natural language as input for model re-presentation. Mitocar creates graphical map for final results. In methodology there is few different steps in which program will use to parse naturall language to create the map. Drawing the map is done by calculating proximity vector from the data. Mitocar can be used in many different ways and with it there is possibility to compare models from different subject domains.

\subsubsection{DEEP}

Deep is methdology focusing on expert-like learning. This means that learning don't have single end point but it is evaluated as continiung process of growth. Deep uses persons ability to understand and solve complex problem spaces in general.
