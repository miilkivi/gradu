% The information on title and abstract is generated automatically depending on

\section{Topic Definition}

Developing software has become more and more working in group. One reason for this is agile methodologies like Scrum and XP that has been come more and more common project management techniques in software development. Groupwork will add it's own challenges and benefits to the development process.

Giving a focus on improving group work is one way to tackle challenges that newer project management practices bring on the table. One of the ways of improvement is achieving better shared understanding between different stakeholders of the development group. Shared understanding is term that describes the level of knoweledge about project that different stakeholders share a same vision.

One way in trying to improve shared understanding in software projects is usage of different kinds of desing methodologies and mapping techniques. In this thesis work I will try to find answer for the question that does this kind of methods create better shared understanding between stakeholders in development group.

\section{Research Plan}


In this research I will use two groups. Both groups will design the solution for same software project. Both groups will consist fo students from department of Computer Science at University of Helsinki. Student subjects will be chosen randomly from the group of students that will participate in course software systems that will be held in autumn 2015.

Student subjects will be divided to groups randomly. After grouping has been done all subjects will answer five factor personality test\cite{fiveFactor}. This test will give me information about personalities and after the experiment I can compare results to allrady known personality questions in group work.

First group will be doing this design sesion without any specific methodology. Idea is trying to find people that don't have so much experience of designing of the software so there will be no great knoweledge about different desing patterns. Second group will be given knowledge about design methodology called User Story Mapping\cite{userStoryMapping}. This methodology will be thought to subjects by researcher.

After training session both groups will work with given problem and will try to design solution as best as they can. These session will be video recorded to gather more material about desing process and for evaluation of usega of desing methodology. When the desing process is finished and subjects will answer three different questionares that will give researcher tools to evaluate achieved shared understanding, created social networks and solution that was achieved.


\section{Previous Studies}

Humayun etc. studied effect of organizational structure in global software development (GSD) \cite{organizationalStructure}. Research question of the paper was set to "What is the impact of 'A clear organizational structure with communicating resposibilities' on shared understanding of requirements in GSD?".
